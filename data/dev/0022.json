    "question": "# A History Lesson\n\nTetris is a puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984. Pajitnov derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.\n\n# About scoring system\n\nThe scoring formula is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear is worth `40` points, clearing four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth `1200`.\n\nA level multiplier is also used. The game starts at level `0`. The level increases every ten lines you clear. Note that after increasing the level, the total number of cleared lines is not reset.\n\nFor our task you can use this table:\n\n\n        .demo {\n    width:70%;\n                border:1px solid #C0C0C0;\n                border-collapse:collapse;\n                padding:5px;\n        }\n        .demo th {\n                border:1px solid #C0C0C0;\n                padding:5px;\n        }\n        .demo td {\n                border:1px solid #C0C0C0;\n                padding:5px;\n        }\n\n\n\nLevel\nPoints for 1 line\nPoints for 2 lines\nPoints for 3 lines\nPoints for 4 lines\n\n\n0\n40\n100\n300\n1200\n\n\n1\n80\n200\n600\n2400\n\n\n2\n120\n300\n900\n3600\n\n\n3\n160\n400\n1200\n4800\n\n\n...\n\n\n7\n320\n800\n2400\n9600\n\n\n...\nFor level n you must determine the formula by yourself using given examples from the table.\n\n\n\n# Task\n\nCalculate the final score of the game using original Nintendo scoring system\n\n# Input\n\nArray with cleaned lines.  \nExample: `[4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2]`  \nInput will always be valid: array of random length (from `0` to `5000`) with numbers from `0` to `4`.\n\n# Ouput\n\nCalculated final score.  \n`def get_score(arr) -> int: return 0`\n\n# Example\n```python\nget_score([4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2]); # returns 4900\n```\nStep 1: `+1200` points for 4 lines (current level `0`). Score: `0+1200=1200`;\\\nStep 2: `+100` for 2 lines. Score: `1200+100=1300`;\\\nStep 3: `+100`. Score: `1300+100=1400`;\\\nStep 4: `+300` for 3 lines (current level still `0`). Score: `1400+300=1700`.\\\nTotal number of cleaned lines 11 (`4 + 2 + 2 + 3`), so level goes up to `1` (level ups each 10 lines);\\\nStep 5: `+600` for 3 lines (current level `1`). Score: `1700+600=2300`;\\\nStep 6: `+2400`. Score: `2300+2400=4700`;\\\nStep 7: `+200`. Total score: `4700+200=4900` points.\n\n# Other  \n\nIf you like the idea: leave feedback, and there will be more katas in the Tetris series.\n\n* 7 kyuTetris Series #1 \u2014 Scoring System\n* 6 kyuTetris Series #2 \u2014 Primitive Gameplay\n* 6 kyuTetris Series #3 \u2014 Adding Rotation (TBA)\n* 5 kyuTetris Series #4 \u2014 New Block Types (TBA)\n* 4 kyuTetris Series #5 \u2014 Complex Block Types (TBA?)",
