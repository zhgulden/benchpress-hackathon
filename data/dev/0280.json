    "question": "With one die of 6 sides we will have six different possible results:```  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6``` .\n\nWith 2 dice of six sides, we will have 36 different possible results:\n``` \n(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(1,4),(4,1),(1,5),\n(5,1), (1,6),(6,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(2,4),(4,2),\n(2,5),(5,2)(2,6),(6,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3),\n(3,6),(6,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(4,6),(6,4),(5,5),\n(5,6),(6,5),(6,6)\n``` \nSo, with 2 dice of 6 sides we get 36 different events.\n``` \n([6,6] ---> 36)\n``` \nBut with 2 different dice we can get for this case, the same number of events.\nOne die of ```4 sides```  and another of ```9 sides```  will produce the exact amount of events.\n``` \n([4,9] ---> 36)\n``` \nWe say that the dice set ```[4,9]``` is equivalent to ```[6,6]``` because both produce the same number of events.\n\nAlso we may have an amount of three dice producing the same amount of events. It will be for:\n``` \n[4,3,3] ---> 36\n``` \n(One die of 4 sides and two dice of 3 sides each)\n\nPerhaps you may think that the following set is equivalent: ```[6,3,2]``` but unfortunately dice have a **minimum of three sides** (well, really a \ntetrahedron with one empty side)\n\nThe task for this kata is to get the amount of equivalent dice sets, having **2 dice at least**,for a given set.\n\nFor example, for the previous case: [6,6] we will have 3 equivalent sets that are: ``` [4, 3, 3], [12, 3], [9, 4]``` .\n\nYou may assume that dice are available from 3 and above for any value up to an icosahedral die (20 sides).\n``` \n[5,6,4] ---> 5 (they are [10, 4, 3], [8, 5, 3], [20, 6], [15, 8], [12, 10])\n``` \nFor the cases we cannot get any equivalent set the result will be `0`.\nFor example for the set `[3,3]` we will not have equivalent dice.\n\nRange of inputs for Random Tests:\n``` \n3 <= sides <= 15\n2 <= dices <= 7\n``` \nSee examples in the corresponding box.\n\nEnjoy it!!",
