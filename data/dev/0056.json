    "question": "Your job is to change the given string `s` using a non-negative integer `n`.\n\nEach bit in `n` will specify whether or not to swap the case for each alphabetic character in `s`: if the bit is `1`, swap the case; if its `0`, leave it as is. When you finished with the last bit of `n`, start again with the first bit.\n\nYou should skip the checking of bits when a non-alphabetic character is encountered, but they should be preserved in their original positions.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nswap('Hello world!', 11)  -->  'heLLO wORLd!'\n```\n...because `11` is `1011` in binary, so the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th alphabetical characters have to be swapped:\n```\nH e l l o  w o r l d !\n1 0 1 1 1  0 1 1 1 0\n^   ^ ^ ^    ^ ^ ^\n```\n\nMore examples:\n```\nswap(\"gOOd MOrniNg\", 7864)  -->  \"GooD MorNIng\"\nswap('', 11345)  -->  ''\nswap('the lord of the rings', 0)  -->  'the lord of the rings'\n```",
