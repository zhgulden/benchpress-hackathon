    "question": "In Spanish, the conjugated verb changes by adding suffixes and according to the person we're talking about. There's something similar in English when we talk about \"She\", \"He\"or \"It\" (3rd person singular):\n\nWith the verb \"run\":\n\n**He / She / It runS**\n\n\nAs you can see, the rule (at least with regular verbs) is to add the suffix  \"-s\" in the 3rd person singular. In Spanish it works the same way but we need to remove the **infinitive suffix** and add a specific suffix to all the others persons (I, You, He/She/It, We, You, They).\n\nVerbs in Spanish and the infinitive suffix.\n--\n\nIn Spanish we assume a verb is on its infitive form when it has one of the infinitives suffixes (**AR**, **ER** or **IR**) at the end:\n\n- Com**er** -> to eat\n\n- Camin**ar** -> to walk\n\n- Viv**ir** -> to live\n\n## How to conjugate\n\n\nFor conjugating in Spanish, we need to remove the infinitive suffix (**ar**, **er** *or* **ir**) and add the personal suffixes corresponding to the person we're talking to. In this kata we'll conjugate the verbs to its **presente indicativo** (simple present) form.\n\nPersonal suffixes\n--\nThe personal suffixes changes depending of the **Infinitive suffix**.\n\nIf the infinitive suffix is **AR** the personal suffixes are:\n\n- first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**\n- second person singular (T\u00fa / You): -**as**\n- third person singular (\u00c9l, Ella / He, She): -**a**\n- first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**amos**\n- second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**\u00e1is**\n- third person plural (Ellos / They): -**an**\n\nIf the infinitive suffix is **ER**:\n- first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**\n- second person singular (T\u00fa / You): -**es**\n- third person singular (\u00c9l, Ella / He, She): -**e**\n- first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**emos**\n- second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**\u00e9is**\n- third person plural (Ellos / They): -**en**\n\nIf the infinitive suffix is **IR**:\n- first person singular (Yo / I): -**o**\n- second person singular (T\u00fa / You): -**es**\n- third person singular (\u00c9l, Ella / He, She): -**e**\n- first person plural (Nosotros / We): -**imos**\n- second person plural (Vosotros / You): -**\u00eds**\n- third person plural (Ellos / They): -**en**\n\n## Conjugating \nSteps for conjugating:\n1. Remove the infinitive suffix (ar, er, ir)\n2. And add the personal suffixes\n- Example: verb **Caminar** (to walk)\n  - Camin**o** (I walk)\n  - Camin**as** (You walk)\n  - Camin**a** (He walks)\n  - Camin**amos** (We walk)\n  - Camin**\u00e1is** (You guys walk)\n  - Camin**an** (They walk)\n- Example: verb **Comer** (to eat):\n  - Com**o** (I eat)\n  - Com**es** (You eat)\n  - Com**e** (He, She eats)\n  - Com**emos** (We eat)\n  - Com**\u00e9is** (You guys eat)\n  - Com**en** (They eat)\n- Example: verb **Vivir** (to live):\n  - Viv**o** (I live)\n  - Viv**es** (You live)\n  - Viv**e** (He, She lives)\n  - Viv**imos** (We live)\n  - Viv**\u00eds** (You guys live)\n  - Viv**en** (They live)\n  \n## Your Task\n\nYou need to write a function called **conjugate** which will return an object with a spanish verb conjugated. The object must look like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"comer\": [\n    \"como\",\n    \"comes\",\n    \"come\",\n    \"comemos\",\n    \"com\u00e9is\",\n    \"comen\"\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\nWhere the key is the verb in its original form (infinitive form) and its value will be an array with the conjugations.\n\nAnother example:\n```\n{\n  \"vivir\": [\n    \"vivo\",\n    \"vives\",\n    \"vive\",\n    \"vivimos\",\n    \"viv\u00eds\",\n    \"viven\"\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n## Notes:\n1. The conjugations must be in this order:\n```\n{\n    verb: [\n      \"first person singular\",\n      \"second person singular\",\n      \"third person singular\",\n      \"first person plural\",\n      \"second person plural\",\n      \"third person plural\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n2.Don't use `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)` because the \"presentation\" of the object isn't important.\n\n3.Don't use accents in Python version\n\n\n **Buena suerte!**\n---",
