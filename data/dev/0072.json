    "question": "You have a grid with `$m$` rows and `$n$` columns. Return the number of unique ways that start from the top-left corner and go to the bottom-right corner. You are only allowed to move right and down.\n\nFor example, in the below grid of `$2$` rows and `$3$` columns, there are `$10$` unique paths:\n\n```\no----o----o----o\n|    |    |    |\no----o----o----o\n|    |    |    |\no----o----o----o\n```\n\n**Note:** there are random tests for grids up to 1000 x 1000 in most languages, so a naive solution will not work.\n\n---\n*Hint: use mathematical permutation and combination*",
