    "question": "Just another day in the world of Minecraft, Steve is getting ready to start his next exciting project -- building a railway system!\n\n![Alt text](http://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1506/2015-02-02_0156508603066.jpg)\n\nBut first, Steve needs to melt some iron ores in the furnace to get the main building blocks of rails -- iron ingots. ![Alt text](http://www.blocksandgold.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/35x/cbcbef48e5e3bcce7c7ed908f20bc5b4/i/r/ironingot_icon32.png)\n\nEach iron ingot takes 11 seconds* to produce. Steve needs a lot of them, and he has the following fuel options to add into the furnace: \n\n* Buckets of lava, each lasts 800 seconds* ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/bucketL.gif)\n* Blaze rod, each lasts 120 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/blazerod.gif)\n* Coals, each lasts 80 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/coal.gif)\n* Blocks of Wood, each lasts 15 seconds ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/itemGifs/logs.gif)\n* Sticks, each lasts 1 second* ![Alt text](http://www.minecraftguides.org/images/items/stick.gif)\n\nIn Ruby: \nWrite a function `calc_fuel` that calculates the **minimum** amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return a hash of the form `{:lava => 2, :blaze_rod => 1, :coal => 1, :wood => 0, :stick => 0}`\nIn JavaScript:\nWrite a function `calcFuel` that calculates the **minimum** amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return an object of the form `{lava: 2, blazeRod: 1, coal: 1, wood: 0, stick: 0}`\nIn Python:\nWrite a function `calc_fuel` that calculates the **minimum** amount of fuel needed to produce a certain number of iron ingots. This function should return a dictionary of the form `{\"lava\": 2, \"blaze rod\": 1, \"coal\": 1, \"wood\": 0, \"stick\": 0}`\n\n---\n*fictional values\n\nTo all the Minecraft players out there: \nfeel free to expand this series or let me know if you have any ideas related to Minecraft that can be turned into codewars puzzles. Some ideas I have that might potentially be turned into katas:\n\n* distance traveled in real world vs. in Nether\n* shortest path problems related to mining diamonds/gold/goodies that appears in different levels under ground\n* growth of animal population from breeding\n* redstone stuff?!\n\nIf you do end up expanding this series, please send me a link of your kata so I can check it out and include a link to your kata here :-)\n\n* [Minecraft Series #1: Steve wants to build a beacon pyramid](https://www.codewars.com/kata/minecraft-series-number-1-steve-wants-to-build-a-beacon-pyramid/ruby)\n* [Minecraft Series #3: Lava is amazing! ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583a23d40cf946ec380002c2)\n* [Minecraft Series #4: Lava is amazing, however...](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583a6b0b171f3a3c3f0003e3)",
